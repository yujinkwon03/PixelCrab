# ðŸ¦€ Pixel Crab Shader Project
This project explores animated pixel art using OpenGL (C++) and GLSL shaders. I created and animated two versions of a pixel crab:

  Manual Crab: Constructed by manually placing vertices for each pixel, using a hand-written integer map.

  Textured Crab: A more efficient version using only four vertices and a pixel-art texture.

Both versions were animated with the same walk cycle. During this process, I learned that the textured version allowing for a higher number of crabs on screen due to its simplicity and performance benefits. I also implemented fragment shaders (see pixelCrabShader.frag) that dynamically alter the crab's colors based on parameters like time and positionâ€”though these are not active in the latest build.

The current executable includes interactive flocking behavior, where crabs are attracted to the mouse position. I also implemented preliminary code for crab-to-crab repulsion, but found it challenging to make the resulting movement feel visually pleasing within the constraints of pixel-style animationâ€”so that feature is currently commented out.
